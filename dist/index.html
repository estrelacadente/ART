  <p2>(1/19) oh wow this a paragraph. as for a general post about this website, i'm feeling pretty good about what i already know. most of this i picked up from tumblr or neocities, especially just having to teach myself through trial and error. i even remade my neocities so i could have an inspiration for future projects. my old neocities is like uraharashop or something like that, let me see if i can find it.
  Update: it is infact <a href="https://uraharashop.neocities.org"> still online</a>, however i guess something on the site got a bit fucked since i last checked it, and now it no longer works as intended. I don't really have acess to it anymore, so enjoy my 16 year old brain that failed. it used to have multiple sites connected to it that acted as an individual blog, it was very myspace core. my tumblr html seems to still work as intended, although i borrowed the html from someone else. i think my tumblr is a good representation of how i like my sites to look. check it <a href="https://beachlifendeath.tumblr.com">here</a>. my favorite part about that site is that the windows move :D as for more future internet related aesthetics, i used to be really into vaporwave, i like old windows (98/95), and i used to be really into homestuck when i was 15. that should say a lot about me haha. also i hope my favorite color is obvious by now (it's teal). also i have the gen z curse of never capitalizing unless i have to. do. you like my capybara? i feel like the internet moves on too quick from cute animals. i will never forget the capybara like tiktok did. i don't even have a tiktok i'll never forgive them. also unrelated but i use comic sans since it's easier to read! i usually use a different font, but i'd have to go through the trouble of downloading a custom font which i don't want to do. </p2>
